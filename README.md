# Principles
- No JavaScript (only native HTML page interactivity)
- No custom fonts, use a range of [system fonts](https://modernfontstacks.com)
- Use MathML for math rendering
- Just raw HTML

## Writing Posts
In practice, I use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to take my Obsidian notes and convert them to HTML.
In the process it also renders Latex as MathML!
For more details, see `convert.sh`.
