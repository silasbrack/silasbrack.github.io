# Principles
- No JavaScript (only native HTML page interactivity)
- No custom fonts, use a range of [system fonts](https://modernfontstacks.com)
- Use MathML for math rendering
- Just raw HTML

In practice, I use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to take my Obsidian notes and convert them to HTML, and [temml](https://temml.org) for rendering Latex as MathML.
