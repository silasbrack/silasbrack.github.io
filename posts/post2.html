          $$\bar{x} := \bigg(\prod_{i=0}^N x_i\bigg)^{1 / N}$$
          $$\log \bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \bigg(\sum_{i=0}^N \log x_i\bigg),$$
          i.e., the logarithm of the geometric mean of a variable is given by the arithmetic mean of the logarithm of the variable.
        </p>

        <p>For continuously compounding returns, we model the price of the asset as a function of time \(\hat{p}(t)\).
        $$\hat{p}(t) = I \cdot \exp(\bar{r} \cdot t),$$
        Where \(I\) is the initial investment and \(\bar{r}\) is the average rate of return.
        </p>

        It depends on what you want the mean to be. If you're trying to capture multiplicative relationships, e.g., returns (which compound) or exchange rate fluctuations (which have a multiplicative effect on the asset value), then the geometric mean is superior.
