      <section>
        <p>I'm currently employed as a Data Scientist, Senior Associate at Saxo Bank.</p>
        <p>
          I work on developing AI and ML models and deploying them to production. For me, this is both by training
          in-house models and using pre-trained models (and combining the two). In my time at Saxo, I've worked on many
          projects, including both of the client-facing products my team has released:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A representation learning model that learns which stocks <q>Others were interested in</q> for a given stock.
            This model was our first to be integrated into the Saxo Bank platform and used by our customers. As of April
            2024, this model has seen a continuous increase in the number of interactions, and is currently sitting at
            around 70&#x202F;000 monthly interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            A customer support chatbot which showed a 150% improvement over previous solutions in reducing client
            interactions requiring human support. My implementation also reduced costs by around $85&#x202F;000 a year,
            eliminated several highly time-consuming manual steps, and was trivial to extend to all languages covered by
            Saxo.
          </li>
          <!-- <li>A recommender system</li> -->
        </ul>
        <p>Previously, I've also worked as a C# developer at MAN Energy Solutions.</p>
        <p>
          I recently finished my master's in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the Technical University of
          Denmark. During my thesis, I worked on implicit matrix algorithms for performing the Laplace approximation in
          SÃ¸ren Hauberg's group in the section for Cognitive Systems of DTU Compute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academically, I'm interested in machine learning and statistics, from deep learning to network science to
          Bayesian inference to forecasting. I love mathematics and would like to learn more&mdash;though mostly for its
          applications. I really enjoy sitting down and writing code. Finally, I'm interested in the intersection of
          science and society, and science communication is quite important to me. I spend a lot of time trying to learn
          more about how to effectively communicate ideas and really enjoy teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it's important to be well-rounded and to have a broad understanding of the world. On the side, I like
          reading about the humanities, especially economics, philosophy, sociology, and history. I suspect life is
          intrinsically meaningless; I just try to make the most of it by learning, teaching, appreciating beauty
          wherever I can, and by prioritising doing things I enjoy. Because of this, I try to spend a lot of time
          engaging with the arts by reading, watching films, and listening to music. I also really like to cook, and
          have developed a reputation for my food among my friends.
