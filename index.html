          I work on developing AI and ML models and deploying them to production at Saxo Bank. This means both training
          in-house models and using open-source pre-trained models. In my time at Saxo, I've worked on many
          projects, including multiple client-facing products my team has released:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A representation learning model that learns which stocks <q>Others were interested in</q> for a given stock.
            This model was our first to be integrated into the Saxo Bank platform and used by our customers. As of April
            2024, this model has seen a continuous increase in the number of interactions, and is currently sitting at
            around 70&#x202F;000 monthly interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            A customer support chatbot which showed a 150% improvement over previous solutions in reducing client
            interactions requiring human support. My implementation also reduced costs by around $85&#x202F;000 a year,
            eliminated several highly time-consuming manual steps, and was trivial to extend to all languages covered by
            Saxo.
          </li>
          <li>
            A recommender engine
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previously, I've also worked as a C# developer at MAN Energy Solutions.</p>
        <p>
          I did my master's in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the Technical University of Denmark. During my
          thesis, I worked on implicit matrix algorithms for performing the Laplace approximation in SÃ¸ren Hauberg's
          group in the section for Cognitive Systems of DTU Compute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academically, I'm interested in machine learning and statistics, from deep learning to network science to
          Bayesian inference to forecasting. I love applied math and writing code, so I try to do as much of
          those as possible. I'm also interested in the intersection of science and society, and science
          communication is quite important to me. I spend a lot of time trying to learn more about how to effectively
          communicate ideas and generally just enjoy teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I try to learn more about fields I'm less well-versed in. Right now, that means
          economics, philosophy, paleontology, and history. I try to make the most of life by
          learning and teaching, going on walks in nature, appreciating beauty wherever I can, and by (mostly) doing things I enjoy. Because of
          this, I try to spend my time coding, reading, watching films and series, and listening to music. I also really
          like to cook.
