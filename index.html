          I develop AI and ML models and deploy them to production at Saxo Bank.
          This means both training in-house models and using open-source
          pre-trained models. In my time at Saxo, I've worked on many projects,
          including multiple client-facing products my team has released:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A representation learning model that learns which stocks
            <q>Others were interested in</q> for a given stock. This model was
            our first to be integrated into the Saxo Bank platform and used by
            our customers. As of February 2025, this model has seen a continuous
            increase in the number of interactions, and is currently sitting at
            well over 100&#x202F;000 monthly interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            A customer support chatbot which showed a 170% improvement over
            previous solutions in reducing client interactions requiring human
            support. My implementation also reduced costs by around
            $150&#x202F;000 a year, eliminated several highly time-consuming
            manual steps, and was trivial to extend to all languages covered by
            Saxo.
          </li>
          <li>A recommender engine designed to be simple and extensible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Previously, I've also worked as a C# developer at MAN Energy
          Solutions.

          I did my master's in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the

          I worked on implicit matrix algorithms for performing the Laplace
          approximation in Søren Hauberg's group in the section for Cognitive
          Systems of DTU Compute. We also worked on applying the Laplace
          approximation to metric learning, which we published at NeurIPS<label

          Academically, I'm interested in machine learning and statistics, from
          deep learning to network science to Bayesian inference to forecasting.
          I love applied math and writing code, so I try to do as much of those
          as possible. I'm also interested in the intersection of science and
          society, and science communication is quite important to me. I spend a
          lot of time trying to learn more about how to effectively communicate
          ideas and generally just enjoy teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I try to learn more about fields I'm less
          well-versed in. Right now, that means economics, philosophy,
          paleontology, and history. I try to make the most of life by learning
          and teaching, going on walks in nature, appreciating beauty wherever I
          can, and by (mostly) doing things I enjoy. Because of this, I try to
          spend my time coding, reading, watching films and series, and
          listening to music. I also really like to cook.
