          I work on developing AI and ML models and deploying them to production at Saxo Bank. This means both training
          in-house models and using open-source pre-trained models. In my time at Saxo, I've worked on many
          projects, including multiple client-facing products my team has released:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A representation learning model that learns which stocks <q>Others were interested in</q> for a given stock.
              This model was our first to be integrated into the Saxo Bank platform and used by our customers. As of February
              2025, this model has seen a continuous increase in the number of interactions, and is currently sitting at
              well over 100&#x202F;000 monthly interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              A customer support chatbot which showed a 170% improvement over previous solutions in reducing client
              interactions requiring human support. My implementation also reduced costs by around $150&#x202F;000 a year,
              eliminated several highly time-consuming manual steps, and was trivial to extend to all languages covered by
              Saxo.
            </li>
            <li>
              A recommender engine designed to be simple and extensible.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Previously, I've also worked as a C# developer at MAN Energy Solutions.</p>
        <p>
          I did my master's in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the Technical University of Denmark. During my
          thesis<label for="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>,
          <span class="sidenote">
            <a href="./assets/thesis.pdf">“Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning: Tapping Into the Potential of Modern Optimizers”</a>
          </span>
          I worked on implicit matrix algorithms for performing the Laplace approximation in Søren Hauberg's
          group in the section for Cognitive Systems of DTU Compute. We also worked on applying the Laplace approximation to metric
          learning, which we published at NeurIPS<label for="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.
          <span class="sidenote">

          Academically, I'm interested in machine learning and statistics, from deep learning to network science to
          Bayesian inference to forecasting. I love applied math and writing code, so I try to do as much of
          those as possible. I'm also interested in the intersection of science and society, and science
          communication is quite important to me. I spend a lot of time trying to learn more about how to effectively
          communicate ideas and generally just enjoy teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I try to learn more about fields I'm less well-versed in. Right now, that means
          economics, philosophy, paleontology, and history. I try to make the most of life by
          learning and teaching, going on walks in nature, appreciating beauty wherever I can, and by (mostly) doing things I enjoy.
          Because of this, I try to spend my time coding, reading, watching films and series, and listening to music.
          I also really like to cook.
